# Pure JS audio player

This project is day #1 of <a href="https://www.github.com/grigoryan-m/31-javascript-projects.git">31-javascript-projects</a>!

No libraries are used. Pure Javascript.
Tracks are sorted to folders in 'src' folder of project.

JS code is commented.

Few hotkeys are working: 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Hotkey</th>
    <th>Action</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Spacebar/K</td>
    <td>Play/Pause</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>J</td>
    <td>Previous track</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>L</td>
    <td>Next track</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Thinking about adding 5-second timeskip with arrow buttons.
