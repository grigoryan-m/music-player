# Pure JS audio player

This project is day #1 of <a href="https://www.github.com/grigoryan-m/100-day-javascript.git">100-day-javascript</a>!

No libraries are used. Pure Javascript.
Tracks are sorted to folders in 'src' folder of project.

JS code is commented.

Few hotkeys are working: 

Spacebar / K -> Pause/Play
J -> Previous track
L -> Next track

Thinking about adding 5-second timeskip with arrow buttons.
